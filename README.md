# NLP-ML-project
This project involves natural language processing and performs sentiment analysis on a series of comments to compute a sentiment score for each comment based on a "bag-of-words" model.

Subsequently, a model was built to predict the sentiment scores of all future comments. The model was optimised using GridSearchCV.
